Ingredients:

Cucumber - 1 cup
Carrot -1

Beans -6-7
Potato -1
Raw plantain -1
Raw Mango - few pieces (5-6 medium size pieces)
Elephant foot yam -100 grams
Curd -2 tbsp

Directions:

For the grinding

Grated coconut - 1 cup
Cumin seeds /Jeera - 1/2 tsp
Green chilli -3

For the seasoning

Coconut oil - 2-3 tsp
Curry leaves - few

Preparation

Peel the skin and cut all the vegetables into 2 inch long piece.

Coarsely grind grated coconut, green chillies and cumin seeds. Keep it aside.

Method

Since each vegetable needs different time for cooking, I cooked cucumber, plantain and ash gourd together in a pan separately adding salt needed for that alone. When it is half cooked, add chopped raw mangoes.

Pressure cook the rest of the vegetables adding salt and turmeric powder for 2 whistles.You can cook in open pan also.The vegetables should be soft but not mushy. (use very less water and cook)

Add the grounded coconut paste and cook for a few minutes. Remove from flame.

Add curd and mix well. Check for salt. Season with coconut oil and curry leaves.
